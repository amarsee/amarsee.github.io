## Why This?

This topic isn't related to data, but it's been something I've been wanting to write about. My fiancee lives in Brazil, so I've had the pleasure of traveling to Brazil on a few occasions. 

In my travels I have been to a number of airports in Brazil. Some are better than others. Some put American airports to shame, and others are a shame even by American standards. These rankings are limited to the airports I have been to, which are Cuiabá, Belem, Goiânia, São Paulo Congonhas, São Paulo Guarulhos, Viracopos (Campinas), Curitiba, Brasília, and Palmas. I'll update the rankings as I visit more airports.

Let's get into the rankings. I'll start from worst and finish with the best.

## The rankings

### Cuiabá
Cuiabá's Marechal Rondon International Airport did not impress me during the layover I had there. It's a very small airport, much like the others on the list, but this airport had drawbacks that the others did not. For one, it was crowded and there was little air circulation. It was small, but people were packed in there. It seemed old and a little dirty too. It could use a renovation. It did have a couple restuarants if you want a bite to eat (like some pão de queijo), however I did not try these restaurants so I can't rate them.

### Belem
The first thing I ever saw in Brazil was Belem's Val de Cans International Airport. It did not leave a great impression. All of us on the flight had to wait well over an hour to receive our luggage. It was a standard 3x3 configuration plane with probably around 180 passengers and we were the only flight arriving at the time. Not to mention that the baggage claim area was hot too. Not a great first impression. Once I got my luggage and made it through security, the airport was pretty bland. A bit like Cuiabá, but maybe a little cleaner and bigger. I barely made my connection and was on my way for the rest of the trip.

### São Paulo Congonhas
São Paulo Congonhas is a big hub for domestic connections in Brazil. I had about a 45 minute layover here on the way to Curitiba. This airport is decent. It's not too big so it's easy to get around for connections. It's not super nice or super dirty. It's adequate. This airport loses points because it's not readily apparent that many flights board via bus from a lower level. We walked all over the main floor looking for the gate and couldn't find it. We finally found it and made the connecting flight with 20 minutes to spare.
