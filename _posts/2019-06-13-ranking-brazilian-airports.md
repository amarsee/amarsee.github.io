## Why This?

This topic isn't related to data, but it's been something I've been wanting to write about. My fiancee lives in Brazil, so I've had the pleasure of traveling to Brazil on a few occasions. 

In my travels I have been to a number of airports in Brazil. Some are better than others. Some put American airports to shame, and others are a shame even by American standards. These rankings are limited to the airports I have been to, which are Cuiabá, Belem, Goiânia, São Paulo Congonhas, São Paulo Guarulhos, Viracopos (Campinas), Curitiba, Brasília, and Palmas. I'll update the rankings as I visit more airports.

Let's get into the rankings. I'll start from worst and finish with the best.

## The rankings

9. Cuiabá
Cuiabá's Marechal Rondon International Airport did not impress me during the layover I had there. It's a very small airport, much like the others on the list, but this airport had drawbacks that the others did not. For one, it was crowded and there was little air circulation. It was small, but people were packed in there. It seemed old and a little dirty too. It could use a renovation. It did have a couple restuarants if you want a bite to eat (like some pão de queijo), however I did not try these restaurants so I can't rate them.

8. Belem
The first thing I ever saw in Brazil was Belem's Val de Cans International Airport. It did not leave a great impression. All of us on the flight had to wait well over an hour to receive our luggage. It was a standard 3x3 configuration with probably around 180 passengers and we were the only flight arriving at the time.
