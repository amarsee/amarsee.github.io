## Introduction

It's been a while since I wrote a blog, so I thought I'd write a short one about the merits of a coding bootcamp. I'll be focusing on my experience at the [Nashville Software School](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/) (NSS) in Nashville, TN. It primarily has classes geared toward development, but has recently begun programs in Data Science and Data Analytics. I was in the second Data Science cohort, which was 9 months long with classes in the evenings.

## Do you need a coding background?

This is a question that comes up from time to time. Personally, I had some experience but was by no means an expert. I had a couple classes teaching Matlab in college. This experience is what led me down the path that I went because I really enjoyed those classes. I learned the fundamentals of programming (e.g. loops, recursion, etc.) and was hooked. However, Matlab isn't super common in industry so that specific language didn't turn out to be so useful. So I spent some time trying to learn additional (and perhaps more useful) languages. I learned enough C++ to write simple programs on Arduino boards. I learned basics of machine learning algorithms and how to apply them in Matlab/Octave. 

So you can see that I had some background, but was by no means an expert. And I think that's what is important, some background in any language. The bootcamp doesn't have time to start totally from scratch. Some concepts can take some time to internalize and become second nature and by that time the bootcamp may be a quarter over and you've fallen behind on other concepts. Make sure to spend some time before the start of the bootcamp to refresh coding skills and perhaps statistical concepts for the Data Science portion

## Does the bootcamp really prepare you for a job?

This was my main question/concern heading into it. I can say that it does prepare you for a job. The structure of the course at NSS involved extensive project work with organizations around the city ranging from Metro City Council to private industry. These projects were good experience in developing coding skills as well as seeing what practitioners are looking for in industry. It also had the benefit of developing a GitHub portfolio that would help in the job search. It helps to have something for potential employers to look at and validate skills.

I think the bootcamp prepares you about as well as anybody else coming out of college with a bachelor's or even master's degree. However, you likely won't be able to compete with PhDs unless you have a PhD yourself. And a lot of Data Science jobs are looking for PhDs.

The strength in the bootcamp is in the network. Once there are a few cohorts, there is a network of people who can vouch for your training and assist in landing your first full time role in the industry. It's much easier to get interviews through a network than blindly submitting online applications.

## What are the cons of a bootcamp?

Everything sounds great so far, but it can't all be roses and sunshine can it? It cannot be all rainbows and butterflies. There are some drawbacks. One is that the bootcamps are short. There's a lot to learn so they can't teach everything. I think a big thing that needed more attention was what it looks like to put code into production. It seems simple, but visualizing a data pipeline can be a challenge. Another thing is cloud computing. We briefly touched on AWS, but it would have been nice to have a little more hands on experience.

The other primary drawback I can think of is the numbers of it, meaning the number of the students in the bootcamp and the number of positions in the city, especially a midsize city like Nashville. There's a number of new jobs popping up in the field all the time these days, but there's also students coming out of universities or other bootcamps who want these jobs. There's a lot of competition and not everybody will land a job quickly. Therefore, it is imperative for students to get started early on the job hunt and go the extra mile to set yourseld apart from other applicants. Write readmes for your GitHub repos. Make a website. Talk to guests and go to meetups. These are the things that will set you apart and get noticed by the people who can get you a job.

## Conclusion

Should you do a coding bootcamp? I think it's up to the person and their working style. Could you learn everything on your own in your spare time? Yes. Is it more doable in a bootcamp? Also yes. It's tough to have the discipline for that long and work on the right styles of things in your free time. It's hard to know where to start. But there are enough resources if you're so inclined to go the DIY route.

I think a bootcamp is a good way to change careers. It helped me, that's for sure. Would I do it again? Yes I would. It's something I had wanting to do and I am glad that I did it. I wish everybody else the same luck in their careers. Thanks for reading.
